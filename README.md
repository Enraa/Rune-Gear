# Rune-Gear
A DPS calculator for Old School Runescape using React

This is a calculator written for Old School Runescape using React. This is my first larger scale project with React and the idea is to determine, given a set of gear which is chosen within the web app, the bonuses and damage per second that the player will deal to a target. These stats can be manually adjusted and it will also calculate additional effects such as potions, prayers, attack styles and gear set effects. 


Currently Implemented:

- Gear Selection
- Monster Selection
- Manual Stat Selection
- Manual Monster Stat Selection
- Prayer, Potion, Attack Style selection
- Calculation for Melee, Ranged and Magic Damage
- OSRS Wiki Links for items and monsters



To Do List:

- Gear Set Buttons
- Set Effects
- Clean up CSS to allow usage on narrow devices such as phones
- Performance Optimization



Known Bugs:

- Monster Stats will stick when reloading a monster after overriding it's values
- Levels can be awkward to input numbers directly
- Prayer and Potion buttons will close after selecting one
- Prayer and Potion bonus calculations for Magic are incorrect
