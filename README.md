# Rune-Gear
A DPS calculator for Old School Runescape using React

This is a calculator written for Old School Runescape using React. This is my first larger scale project with React and the idea is to determine, given a set of gear which is chosen within the web app, the bonuses and damage per second that the player will deal to a target. These stats can be manually adjusted and it will also calculate additional effects such as potions, prayers, attack styles and gear set effects. 

Currently Implemented:

- Gear Selection
- Monster Selection
- Manual Stat Selection
- Manual Monster Stat Selection
- Prayer, Potion, Attack Style selection
- Calculation for Ranged Damage only


To Do List:

- Implement Melee and Magic Damage calculations
- Clean up CSS to allow usage on narrow devices such as phones
- Performance Optimization
